Week 4 Tasks
============

Finish preparing your mid-term presentation
-------------------------------------------

You will need to pick a topic on which to give a presentation in the middle of the term. Pick a topic that interests you, to help make this assignment exciting! The topic could be a JavaScript library, a jQuery plugin, the basics of a JavaScript framework, or another JavaScript-related topic that interests you.
Your presentation should include the following, and will be graded based on these criteria:
* A brief overview of the plugin/library/framework/etc., including its purpose, its features, and any benefits it provides over alternative solutions (if applicable). **(5 points)**
* Three example implementations of this plugin/library/framework/etc., using original JavaScript you’ve written to invoke it and pass in different configuration parameters. **(10 points)**
* An explanation of how the plugin/library/framework/etc. itself works, with references to specific lines of code in the plugin/library/framework/etc. You do not have to explain the functionality of every line of code in the plugin/library/framework/etc. (that would not be feasible within the time constraints of the class), but you should aim to discuss at least 50 lines of code. **(10 points)**

The purpose of this presentation is:
* In the workplace, you will often need to go out to the Internet to find a solution appropriate to the project on which you are working. It is important to be able to identify the right tool for the job.
* In a lot of teams (including the one where the instructor works), developers are expected and encouraged to share what they learn with their colleagues, so that everyone can benefit from the tool you have discovered.
* Analyzing how another developer’s code works is helpful both for debugging problems you have with it, and for learning new coding techniques yourself.
